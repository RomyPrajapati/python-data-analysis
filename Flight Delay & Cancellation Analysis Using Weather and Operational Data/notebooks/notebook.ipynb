{"cells":[{"source":"![Plane departing the Pacific Northwest](IMG_8801.JPG)\n\nA prominent airline company in the Pacific Northwest has accumulated extensive data related to flights and weather patterns and needs to understand the factors influencing the departure delays and cancellations to benefit both airlines and passengers. As the data analyst on the team, you decide to embark on this analytical project.\n\nThe aviation industry is dynamic with various variables impacting flight operations. To ensure the relevance and applicability of your findings, you choose to focus solely on flights from the 'pnwflights2022' datasets available from the ModernDive team exported as CSV files. These datasets provide comprehensive information on flights departing in the first half of 2022 from both of the two major airports in this region: SEA (Seattle-Tacoma International Airport) and PDX (Portland International Airport): \n\n- `flights2022.csv` contains information about about each flight including \n\n| Variable   | Description                                          |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| `dep_time`   | Departure time (in the format hhmm) where`NA` corresponds to a cancelled flight        |\n| `dep_delay`  | Departure delay, in minutes (negative for early)    |\n| `origin`     | Origin airport where flight starts (IATA code)\n| `airline`    | Carrier/airline name                        |\n| `dest`       | Destination airport where flight lands (IATA code)  \n\n- `flights_weather2022.csv` contains the same flight information as well as weather conditions such as \n \n| Variable   | Description                                           |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| `visib`      | Visibility (in miles)                                 |\n| `wind_gust`  | Wind gust speed (in mph)  ","metadata":{},"id":"6f4b6b29-6f9a-45ee-96bc-ff4c822d240f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Load libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the data\nflights2022 = pd.read_csv(\"flights2022.csv\")\nflights_weather2022 = pd.read_csv(\"flights_weather2022.csv\")\n\n# Create route column\nflights2022[\"route\"] = flights2022[\"origin\"] + \"-\" + flights2022[\"dest\"]\n\n# Calculate mean departure delay and number of canceled flights for each unique flight route\nroutes_delays_cancels = flights2022.groupby(\"route\").agg(\n    mean_dep_delay=(\"dep_delay\", \"mean\"),\n    total_cancellations=(\"dep_time\", lambda x: x.isna().sum())\n).reset_index()\n\n# Identify routes with the highest mean departure delays\ntop_routes_by_delay = routes_delays_cancels.sort_values(\"mean_dep_delay\", ascending=False).head(9)\n\n# Identify routes with the highest number of cancellations\ntop_routes_by_cancellations = routes_delays_cancels.sort_values(\"total_cancellations\", ascending=False).head(9)\n\n# Create a bar graph for highest number of cancellations\ntop9_route_cancels_bar, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.bar(top_routes_by_cancellations[\"route\"], top_routes_by_cancellations[\"total_cancellations\"])\nax.set_xlabel(\"Route\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Total Cancellations\")\nax.set_title(\"Routes with Highest Number of Cancellations\")\nax.set_xticklabels(top_routes_by_cancellations[\"route\"], rotation=90)\nplt.show()\nplt.close()\n\n# Find mean departure delays and total cancellations by airline\nairlines_delays_cancels = flights2022.groupby(\"airline\").agg(\n    mean_dep_delay=(\"dep_delay\", \"mean\"),\n    total_cancellations=(\"dep_time\", lambda x: x.isna().sum())\n).reset_index()\n\n# Identify airlines with the highest mean departure delay\ntop_airlines_by_delay = airlines_delays_cancels.sort_values(\"mean_dep_delay\", ascending=False).head(9)\n\n# Identify airlines with the highest number of cancellations\ntop_airlines_by_cancellations = airlines_delays_cancels.sort_values(\"total_cancellations\", ascending=False).head(9)\n\n# Create a bar graph for highest mean depearture delay\ntop9_airline_delays_bar, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.bar(top_airlines_by_delay[\"airline\"], top_airlines_by_delay[\"mean_dep_delay\"])\nax.set_xlabel(\"Airline\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Mean Departure Delay\")\nax.set_title(\"Airlines with Highest Mean Departure Delays\")\nax.set_xticklabels(top_airlines_by_delay[\"airline\"], rotation=90)\nplt.show()\n\n# Are departure delays impacted by 10+ mph winds from each airport\nflights_weather2022[\"group\"] = flights_weather2022[\"wind_gust\"].apply(lambda x: \">= 10mph\" if x >= 10 else \"< 10 mph\")\nwind_grouped_data = flights_weather2022.groupby([\"group\", \"origin\"]).agg(\n    mean_dep_delay=(\"dep_delay\", \"mean\")\n)\n\nprint(wind_grouped_data)\n\nwind_response = True","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":2768,"lastExecutedAt":1698658277788,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Start your code here!"},"id":"ebe7f904-ae87-444c-8b2c-4079a9fbc5fe","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
